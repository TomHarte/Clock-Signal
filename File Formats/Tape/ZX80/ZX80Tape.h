// the data passed in; length is in bytes.

// P files aren't a complete copy of the data stored to tape, they're
// a complete copy of the data that would load from tape. The difference
// is that a tape would store the filename, then the data â€” so P files
// are adjusted by the addition of an empty file name at the beginning.
//
// createFromFile looks at the file extension to determine what to do,
// you'll have to tell createWithData what to do for yourself.
